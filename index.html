        <p>In a <a href="http://www.turingarchive.org/viewer/?id=439&amp;title=78a">letter to the zoologist J.Z. Young</a>, British mathematician Alan Turing announced that his theory of embriology could explain, among other things, the connection between leaf arrangements and Fibonacci numbers.</p>
         <blockquote>At present I am not working on the problem at all, but on my mathematical theory of embriology [...]. This is yielding to treatment, and it will so far as I can see, give satisfactory explanations of -<br/> [...]<br/> 
iii) Leaf arrangement, in particular the way the Fibonacci series (0, 1, 1 = 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,.......) comes to be involved.</blockquote>
        <p>A plausible explanation of this fact was given by German physicist Helmut Vogel in <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2F0025-5564%2879%2990080-4">"A better Way to Construct the Sunflower Head"</a>, where he proposed that spiral branches of seeds in a sunflower head are added from the center at an angle of \(137.5^{\circ}\) from the preceding one.<p>
        <svg></svg>
        <p>The interactive visualization shows that even small deviations from this value determine different shapes, not always similar to <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sonnenblume_H%C3%BCllkelch.JPG">how seeds are arranged in a sunflower</a>. Why \(137.5^{\circ}\)? Vogel postulated that</p>
        <blockquote>each new branch fits into the largest still-existing gap between older branches, cutting a constant fraction off that gap.</blockquote>
        <p>Let \(\delta = 2z\pi\) be the angle between two branches. We see that \(z\) can't be a rational, otherwise after enough steps we'd have gaps that will never be filled. Let's instead construct a sequence of rationals \(z_n\) converging to the real \(z\).</p>
        <p>At the \(n\)-th step we'd have \(z_n = \frac{p_n}{q_n}\), which means, counting from \(0\), that the \(q_n\)-th branch coincides with the \(0\)-th and that we've done \(p_n\) turns around the center.</p>
        <p>At the \((n + 1)\)-th step the \(q_n\)-th branch cuts a fraction \(z_{n+1}\) off the gap between branch \(0\) and its neighbor, which was \(\frac{z_n}{p_n} = \frac{1}{q_n}\). Thus the \(q_n\)-th branch lies at \(p_n + \frac{z_{n+1}}{q_n} = q_{n}z_{n + 1}\)turns, therefore \[z_{n + 1} = \frac{p_n}{q_n} + \frac{z_{n+1}}{q_n^2} = \frac{p_n}{q_n}\left(1 - \frac{1}{q_n^2}\right)^{-1} = \frac{p_{n}q_{n}}{q_n^2 - 1}\text{.}\]</p>
        <p>But we also have \(z_{n + 1} = \frac{p_{n + 1}}{q_{n + 1}}\), thus we have the equation \[z_{n + 1} = \frac{p_{n + 1}}{q_{n + 1}} = \frac{p_{n}q_{n}}{q_n^2 - 1}\text{.}\] By substituting \(p_n = F_{2m}\) and \(q_n = F_{2m + 2}\), consecutive Fibonacci numbers of even order, the previous equation becomes \[F_{2m + 2}^2 - 1 = F_{2m}F_{2m + 4}\text{,}\] which follows from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini_and_Catalan_identities">Cassini's Identity</a>.</p>
        <p>Thus, when \(n\rightarrow\infty\), we have that \(z_n\rightarrow \varphi^{-2}\) where \(\varphi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\), the golden ratio, because it is well known that the ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers tends to \(\varphi\). Therefore \[\delta = 2\varphi^{-2}\pi \approx 137.5^{\circ}\text{.}\]</p>
